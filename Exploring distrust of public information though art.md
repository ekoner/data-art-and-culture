Connecting people, ideas and. things.

You’ve made it when there’s a doll made of you, for example Frida Kahlo.

Henry Gibson was tired of being nominated and not winning so bought medals for himself which he wore around Oslo.

Award yourself!

Performance lecture: A lecture in character which is not necessarily factual. You can do a lecture about things that don’t exist or in the character doesn’t exist or is in the past. You can created horrifying experiences for the audience rather than didactic, educational lecture format.

Ritual and irrationality: Temptation to think we are not irrational or prey to ritual e.g. shouting at computers when its futile to get angry at your laptop. Anthromorphising technology. People in the past were rational but still did rituals to ensure for example fruitfulness.

Institutions and authority: Museums and art galleries have a lot of mistuque and authority. Ritual dress in modern form for example hiviz jackets make you disappear because they mark you has a certain type of worker which allows you to do things without being challenged. ID cards are not scrutinesed. We trust the ID. 

Satire and humour: show people how they were caught out - trust issues. Why we trust, who we trust, how trust can be misplaced.

Magical Realism: A touring show 90 minutes long that went out to art galleries, universities and all kinds of strange places. A period in our history loosely based on John Dee - court wizard in the Elizabethan court - no word for scientist. One foot in ritual one foot in science. He did lecture tours talking about mathematics, equations, optics, lenses, algebra. His flying mechanical beetle, created at university, scared people so much he was accused of witchcraft. He also did seances communicating with the spirit world which he called the angelic world. He worked with a convicted fraudster and government agent Edward Kelly. The angels via Edward Kelly, the medium, said “Don’t trust Edward Kelly”. Even a stopped clock tells the time twice a day. 

Close parallels between then and now. Hysteria around catholic conspirators. There were real extremists and also a lot of paranoia around who was an extremist and who wasn’t. Like now, law-abiding Muslims get swept up in extremist narrative.

Clothing: Hundreds of metres of cloth in a ruff which shows the social status of the people in them. Hundreds of hours of someone else’s labour, manufacturing time, cleaning and looking after the starched white ruff. They say a huge amount about the society and culture in which they exists.

Divination and fortune telling: Using analog equipment and the Argos catalogue almost like the i-ching. Modelled on the seaside fortune telling booths. Using interviews and other interrogation techniques. Using the vagueness of the Argos catalogue which everyone could relate to in some way. Shredder to destroy impediments in the form of ritual. Sin eating in the form of eating the bad stuff that other people don’t have the time or energy to process themselves.

Fake tourist board: Isle of Portland supplies the stone used in many official building. Isle is secretive and hollowed out. Close knit community. All th information in the tourist board was false. Tourism being all about stories. Some spectacularly self-evidently magnificent which acropolis is ruins so you have to use your imagination to recreate the glory of the site. Archaeology sites even more so as many are a hole in the ground. People are erased or not even included in history: Women, people of colour, illiterate, LGBT are not recorded. History is essentially erasing the majority of people to record a minority. To include these people in history sometimes means making them up. Tourist board included themes of authority, satire, performance lecture etc. Suturing - being sewn in and obeying the rules of the world while you’re in it. Even painting is suturing, brining you into another world they’ve created through their art. Difference is place and time.

Wizard of Oz AI: coined by someone else - the tech and data industry’s tendency to upplay the sophistication of what they do. All industrial revolutions are propped up by the unseen contributions of human beings. Including AI front end with a human back end force. UI on top of something like mechanical Turk - Amazon’s token payment service to do menial, disempowered, gig-economy work. People are increasingly trusting machines more than people. Breach of trust - person in disguise. Can also be a good thing as in Wizard of Oz, he gives the characters what they want (which is in them anyway). In th ebooks the emerald city is also false, people wear emerald glasses and never take them off outside your own home. Great metaphor for the tech period we’re in. Idea that you can be telling lies to people but in some cases can still lead to a good conclusion .

Tech Bros: Featuring Elon Musk smoking weed in public. Some of us have more reason to trust technology and data than others and some of us are more impacted more than others. By the overriding moral framework of the tech and data industries which is largely dominated by white males, of a certain libertarian viewpoint which impacts the decisions they make and technology that is created. Example, noting to hide, don’t care if anyone knows where I live. Lots of people for whom this is undesirable, black males who can be shot dead, spouses being stalked.

The Palantir: The name of Peter Thiels security AI company. Disruptive industries seem to love dystopian imagery e.g. Gothan and Metropolis - home cities of Batman/Joker and Superman/Lex Luther. Palantir is not neutral - it is sauraumans crystal ball controlled by Sauron which he uses to corrupt - asymmetrical medium. It is an odd, maybe deliberately sinister imagery. Image shown is of Trump and Saudi royal family launching their security project that strongly resembles the Palantir. Tech orgs are deliberately uncritical of their imagery. Plan was to make something that exposes this mentality for example current techniques with backend AI to hoover up information available on anyone else. Done maliciously is doxxing - disproportionately done to minorities and women - for example GamerGate, Saudi women activists sent death/rape threats, swatting. The research showed this can be done now using Maltego (means mist or fog in welsh) software that runs on Linux. Does transforms or search through available information - correlates people’s identities through small amounts of data e.g. email address and other information about them. Works like a virus - looks for everything about them. Has apis for Facebook friend graphs and maps out that person’s identity. Used to investigae Russian hacking to recorelate people operating under multiple identities. Can’t help being sinister with the names. Very hard to trust these players when they can’t help being sinister. Interesting in an intellectual sense but not cool. In a recent conference for insurance companies, representative happily demo how this sucking up of information about people from address without concern for the implications. They just don’t think of these things because they are white men of a certain age and have no experience of the downsides. Decided not to use Maltego because it was too easy - too obvious and base.

Manal al-Sharif: Downsides falling disproportionately on some people - self-exiled from Saudi Arabia. She is a women’s rights activist - women being allowed to drive. She was careful to avoid things women are accused of - reasonable tone - tone policing. Massive harassment online and by authorities. At a conference in Norway, she removed herself from social networks. [Add quote here]. She has decide she needs to find other ways to carry out the activism. Cost vs Benefit isn’t there anymore. Unable to trust the systems that now surround us constantly. Tanzania and Chechnya rounding up gay men via social media and dating apps. Crude but effective network friend graph similar to Maltego.

Pipo-kun: Mascot of Tokyo police force. Can you have authority without being sinister? Japan in general is very safe, but still has it’s own issues. Their chosen interface is through pipo-kun, pipo is slang for police and kun is a term for affection. 

Utopia not dystopia: Not much hope in the tech and data industry. We need hope. We used to be optimistic about technology- it was going to bring us together but instead it is pushing us further apart. We have a responsibility to do contstructive things to push against divisive things.

Oscar Wilde: “All art is quite useless” - role as an artist is not to be pragmatically useful. To create, come to a conclusion. Not a criticism, beauty has a right to exist but does not need to be useful. Making people think is useful. Art is not pragmatic. Art can still change the world. Art has been around for at least 30,000 years. Other occupations have come and gone but art is still here and will continue to be so.
